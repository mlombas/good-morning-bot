Welcome to Good Morning Bot help!
You can set the time at which your bot will say good morning to you with:
    /set_time <your time>
    Although many formats work, it is preferred if you use hour:minute:second
    with two digits for each hour, and 24h format. If the format you tried
    is not supported, then the bot will warn you, dont worry!
You can set the message you want with the following command:
    /set_message <your message>
    It can be pretty much anything you like!

Thank you for using me! Enjoy!
